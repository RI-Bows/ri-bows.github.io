## Overview
RIBows is a web page built by UH students, for UH students to easily find and join Registered Independent Organizations, RIOs. When searching for an RIO, users can either browse through the most trendy RIO's, search for a specific RIO's, or search based on your hobbies and interests. In addition to that users will be able to bookmark an RIO that they are thinking of joining or looks interesting but doesn't want to commit to joining just yet. Users will also be able to fill out a form to join an RIO and RIO users will be able to edit their own RIO page information.
