## Overview
RIBows is a website built by University of Hawaii at Manoa (UHM) students, for UHM students, to easily search for, discover, and join Registered Independent Organizations (RIOs). RIBows gives users the flexibility to browse trending RIOs or search for specific RIOs based on interests or keywords. If a user sees an RIO that interests them, they can use the bookmarking feature to save the RIO for easy future reference. Once a user finds an RIO they want to join, simply clicking the "apply" button allows them to send an application to the RIO admin.

## Admin Features
Via an admin account, RIO admins can edit their RIO, allowing them to customize its image, description, and more. 

## Deployment
The RIBows application was deployed on Vercel through this [link](https://ri-bows.vercel.app/)

## User Guide
This section provides a walkthrough of the RIBows user interface and its capabilities.

## Pages

## Community Feedback
We have also added a feedback page. If the user would like, they could take a couple of minutes to fill out the [RIBows Feedback Form](FeedbackForm). The form asks for the user's email address and a text area to include feedback/improvements for our app.

## Developer Guide

## Development History

### Milestone 1: Mockup development
The goal of Milestone 1 was to create a minimal set of mockup pages to provide a skeleton for the final website. The page designs are still ongoing and most functionality has not been implemented.

Milestone 1 was managed using [RIBows GitHub Project Board M1](https://github.com/orgs/RI-Bows/projects/2):

### Milestone 2: Database implementation
The goal of Milestone 2 was to finish up the mockup pages, connect the spreadsheet of RIOs to the database, and begin to implement database functionalities.

Milestone 2 is managed using [RIBows GitHub Project Board M2](https://github.com/orgs/RI-Bows/projects/6)
